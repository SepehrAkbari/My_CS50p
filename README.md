# CS50P
#### This repository holds all my work in Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P) course. I completed the course in 2023, and very much recommend it to everyone.
###### Using the exact code available in this repository for CS50P labs and final project goes against Harvard's Academic Honesty code. However, do get inspired from the code. #Loving_OpenSource
